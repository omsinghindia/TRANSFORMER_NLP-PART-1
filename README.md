#PyTorch-Transformer
#Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer model using PyTorch. The Transformer architecture is a widely-used model for tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and more. This implementation includes training, inference, and visualization scripts to fully utilize the Transformer.

#Features
Model Architecture: Implements a Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch.
Training: Supports both local training (Local_Train.ipynb) and Google Colab-based training (Colab_Train.ipynb).
Inference: translate.py and Inference.ipynb allow for generating predictions from a trained model.
Beam Search: Implements beam search decoding (Beam_Search.ipynb) for improved inference.
Attention Visualization: attention_visual.ipynb provides tools to visualize attention heads and interpret model behavior.
Weights and Biases Logging: Integrated with Weights and Biases for experiment tracking (train_wb.py).
Requirements
Before running the scripts, install the necessary packages using the provided requirements.txt or conda.txt files:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, if you prefer to use Conda:

bash
Copy code
conda create --name myenv --file conda.txt
conda activate myenv
File Structure
train.py: Script for training the Transformer model.
translate.py: Performs inference and translation using a trained model.
Beam_Search.ipynb: Notebook implementing beam search for improved decoding.
attention_visual.ipynb: Visualizes attention layers for better model interpretability.
dataset.py: Handles data loading and preprocessing for training.
model.py: Contains the Transformer architecture implemented in PyTorch.
config.py: Stores configurations for training and inference.
Local_Train.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training the model on local machines.
Colab_Train.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training the model on Google Colab.
.gitignore: Lists files to be ignored by Git version control.
Usage
Training
To train the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --config config.py
Alternatively, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks for interactive training:

Local Training: Open Local_Train.ipynb
Colab Training: Open Colab_Train.ipynb (optimized for Google Colab)
Inference
To generate translations or other outputs using a trained model:

bash
Copy code
python translate.py --model_path <path_to_model> --input_file <input_data>
Attention Visualization
You can visualize attention heads by running:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook attention_visual.ipynb
Future Work
Adding more pre-trained models.
Optimizing beam search for different tasks.
Extending attention visualization with additional features.
